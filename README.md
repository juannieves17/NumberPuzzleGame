NumberPuzzleGame
================
Here is the Java Project for the Number Puzzle Game that I created in collaboration of Luis A. Rivera.
This is a two player of the Number Puzzle Game with some music. Enjoy!!

Player 1 uses the ARROW KEYS
Player 2 uses WASD KEYS
The program ends either when any of the players solves his/her puzzle or when Alt-F4 is pressed. No 
other key or the mouse should be able to interfere with the game.
